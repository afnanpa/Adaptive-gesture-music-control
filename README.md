🎵✋ Adaptive Gesture Music Control – Python/OpenCV Project
Adaptive Gesture Music Control is a computer vision-based Python application that lets users control music playback using hand gestures, providing a touch-free, intuitive way to interact with a media player.

📦 Features
Detects hand gestures using a webcam in real-time

Controls music functions such as:

Play/Pause

Next/Previous Track

Volume Up/Down

Adapts to different lighting conditions and backgrounds using OpenCV

Lightweight and user-friendly interface

Designed for accessibility and convenience

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV – for image processing and gesture detection

Media Player API (e.g., pycaw, pygame, or python-vlc) – to handle audio playback

NumPy – for array-based computations (optional)

🚀 How It Works
A webcam captures the user's hand in real-time.

OpenCV detects hand gestures by analyzing contours or finger count.

The system maps each gesture to a specific music command (e.g., 1 finger = Play, 2 fingers = Pause).

Commands are sent to the media player instantly.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Real-time image processing

Gesture recognition using contours/finger tracking

Integration of computer vision with audio control

Event-driven logic using Python
